# ![PS4](https://img.shields.io/badge/-PS4-003791?style=flat&logo=PlayStation) Linux Payloads for FW 5.05 - 13.02
(Southbridge: Aeolia & Belize(2) & Baikal)

**Linux-Payloads** kexec for PlayStation 4.

The host with precompiled Linux payloads works well with GoldHEN's PayLoader. Just open the web browser and cache the host—it will also work offline too.

## Info 
the internal path by default is at: ``/data/linux/boot``  
the rest is coming from the initramfs.cpio.gz init configuration
so you can go into the rescue shell without a usb stick just upload the ``bzImage`` and ``initramfs.cpio.gz`` over ftp to your PS4 Drive
``/data/linux/boot/[bzimage,initramfs.cpio.gz]`` 
and of course it will work too with a USB / HDD Drive.  USB have highest prio so if a USB is connected he will  use this bzImage and initramfs.cpio.gz from there 

### vram.txt
Control VRAM size via a plain text file containing a number in **MB** (not GB).

| vram.txt value | VRAM allocated | Payload suffix |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| `32`  | 32 MB  | `-32mb`  |
| `64`  | 64 MB  | `-64mb`  |
| `128` | 128 MB | `-128mb` |
| `256` | 256 MB | `-256mb` |
| `512` | 512 MB | `-512mb` |
| `1024` | 1 GB | `-1gb` |
| `2048` | 2 GB | `-2gb` |
| `3072` | 3 GB | `-3gb` |
| `4096` | 4 GB | `-4gb` |

Default is 1024 MB (1 GB) if vram.txt is missing or invalid. Minimum is **32 MB**.

> **Note:** 32 MB and 64 MB VRAM payloads work (tested on Aeolia/Belize). These are not included in the default precompiled releases, but you can compile them yourself by editing the `SIZES_MB` variable in the Makefile.

## Server Use (Low VRAM Payloads)

- **Why 32MB, 64MB, 128MB, 256MB, 512MB?** The idea behind these low VRAM payloads is for users who are repurposing the PS4 as a server for RAM and CPU intensive tasks. If you're just running server stuff headless, you don't need 1GB+ of memory wasted on the GPU. Using these payloads frees up that shared unified memory to be used as regular system RAM instead. 

- **How to use:** 
  - **Option 1:** Just run the payload with the desired VRAM size (e.g. `-32mb`, `-64mb`, etc.).
  - **Option 2:** Add the value (e.g. `32`, `64`, `128`, etc.) into your `vram.txt` file to set it manually. Don't use these if you plan on gaming or using heavy desktop graphics!

## Note 
* Use .elf`s files instead of .bin whenever possible as they provide a better success rate. 
* Don't use a Baikal payload on a non Baikal console.
* if you need UART just add this to the cmdline i have disabled .... just for now on newer Kernel it doesnt work.

Aeolia/Belize: ``console=uart8250,mmio32,0xd0340000``

Baikal: ``console=uart8250,mmio32,0xC890E000``


## How to Compile
    git clone https://github.com/ArabPixel/ps4-linux-payloads
    cd ps4-linux-payloads/linux
    # Edit the Makefile SIZES_MB variable to add 32 or 64 if you want those payloads
    make

## Change log

- Sub-1GB VRAM payloads – Added 128mb, 256mb and 512mb payload sizes for PS4 used as a headless server where GPU memory is largely unused. Set `vram.txt` to `128`, `256` or `512` (MB) to use them. [v22](https://github.com/ArabPixel/ps4-linux-payloads/releases/tag/v22)
- **128MB VRAM payloads are now supported (compile yourself by editing Makefile).**

- PS4 12.5x, 13.0x Support. [v21.5](https://github.com/ArabPixel/ps4-linux-payloads/releases/tag/v21.5)

- Automatic boot files placement – The kernel (bzImage) and initramfs.cpio.gz are now automatically copied to /data/linux/boot on the internal drive from the external fat32 partition. Why? No external drive is needed to boot into the rescue shell, only first time.

- RTC time passed to initramfs – The current time from OrbisOS is added to the kernel command line (time=CURRENTTIME), ensuring the correct time is set at boot instead of defaulting to 1970, even if the RTC hardware cannot be read directly. Why? why not. but you need a prepared initramfs that reads the Time from the cmdline and set the time.

bootargs.txt you can also add a textfile for changing the cmdline.
